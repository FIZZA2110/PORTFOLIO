### 💡 About Me

I'm a passionate cybersecurity student with a knack for analyzing threats, decrypting suspicious behavior, and protecting systems from the inside out.  
I thrive in high-alert environments where every log could hold the key to detecting malicious activity.  
My current focus is on real-time **threat response**, deep log analysis, and building defensive architectures that keep attackers out—without them ever knowing I was watching 👀.
